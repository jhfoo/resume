# We are shaped by what we learnt
My career is best described in 2 phases: Before and During (life in the United States).

BEFORE coming to the States, I spent more than 10 years as a software developer in various 
startups. Researched 3G and IPv6 back in 1999 with Deutsche Telekom. Wrote learning portals 
serving over 200 schools with Perl. Built on-premise enterprise Cisco-integrated software 
used by the likes of BP, Barclays, and Sime Darby using C# and Javascript. The culmuination 
of my technical experience was the deployment of a massive data discovery tool for a national 
agency; details of which cannot be elaborated.

DURING my time in the States, my career took a more focused path. I straddled between program
and product management in various companies within the Developer Excellence domain, helping 
developers navigate new technologies and processes brought on by cloud adoption; known also 
as Technology Transformation. At its height I lead a 200-engineer initiative to productize
a cloud serivces framework enabling developers more autonomy and transparency over services
they care about (databases), while simplifying complexities of elastic compute (kubernetes).
