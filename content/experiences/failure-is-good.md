# Failure is Good
## Fear of Failure
Many people fear failure; we are reluctant to talk about our failures as part of our
life journey. In many cultures especially in Asia, one's failure is a reflection of
the family, or an unspoken judgement one carries until success is attained. Maybe
that's why Facebook and social media are popular with stories and pictures of people
in various hints of being successful.

## Understanding Failure
The truth is, everyone fails at various points of their life; be it personal or 
professional. More often than not, they are eventually overcome, or the penalties 
paid and moved on.

Failure is an expensive lesson, and should be understood this way. Sometimes self
analysis happens implicitly, and I will list a few critical questions below:

1. What were the signs of impending failure?
2. What were my options?
3. What was my mistake; was it in execution or decision?
4. Who are the people who can help me succeed?
5. What did I learn from this?
6. What was right, and I should continue to do?
7. If I do this again, will I succeed?

## Celebrating Failure
A corporate culture that accepts failure among its staff creates psychological
safety. 

As we continue to explore new business and tech frontiers, working through
ambiguity is front and center of it all; do customers respond better with vendor-
created imagery? We conduct experiments to get objective feedback. Sometimes the 
feedback suggests the futility in progressing with the work; is that failure
because the project gets cancelled, or success because we saved time and resources?

Forms of acceptances include:

1. Blameless post-mortems.
2. Airing failures in retrospectives (with a plan to improve iteratively).
3. Talking about cancelled projects in town halls.
