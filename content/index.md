# Hello, World
This site is the summation of my perspectives working in technology since graduation in 1998. 

I witnessed the .com bubble burst in 2000, the rise of mobile as dominant prevalent interface, 
prevalance of micro sensors and computer (IoT), and the emergence of cloud technologies. As 
with many others I picked up new skills, unlearnt some, and stayed curious about the next 
disruptive tech. 

If my skills are what you're looking for, let's talk!
